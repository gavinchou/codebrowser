## Build new codebrowser project with template

There are 2 scripts to help,
one for generating CMakeLists.txt one for generating html docs.

0. Keep directory like the following structure
	```
	.
	├── build.sh
	└── src
	    ├── project-a-root-dir
	    │   └── gen_cmakelist.sh
	    └── project-b-root-dir
	        └── gen_cmakelist.sh
	```
1. Change `src_dir` and `inc_dir`in `gen_cmakelist.sh` and execute it, and then
	 we get a new CMakeLists.txt, if there exists one remember to backup it if
	 needed
2. Go to directory of `build.sh`, and change the following as needed.
	```
	project_name=a-new-project
	path_to_project=`pwd`/src/a-new-project
	version='master-20210106'
	```
3. Execute `build.sh` and wait, redirect the output somewhere if needed, because
	 there may a lot of messages generated by codebrowser.
4. Read the 2 scripts for more details if you want to change more settings.
